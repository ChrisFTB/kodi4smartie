Kodi4Smartie v2.0
=================

Kodi4Smartie is a DLL plugin for LCD Smartie(http://lcdsmartie.sourceforge.net/) which listens for notification from Kodi and displays information on a 2 line LCD character display. While the default line width is 20 character there is no reason it can’t be configured for a short or longer width.

Installation
------------

1) Download the zip file containing the Kodi4Smartie DLL and associated files.
2) Copy the kodi4smartie.dll and the kodi4smartie.cfg to the LCD Smartie plugins folder.
3) Copy the cpprest120_2_6.dll to the LCD Smartie folder.

The DLL provides the following LCD Smartie functions:

Function 1: Is meant to be displayed on line 1 of an LCD display. It shows title information as well as other navigation information (FF, rew, Volume)

Function 2: Is meant to be displayed on line 2 of an LCD display. Upon initial playing of a title Kodi4Smartie shows various lines of information about the title. It then shows current progress in a title.

Function 3: Lets you know if Kodi is running. It can be used for custom actions inside LCD Smartie.

Function 4: Displays the current version of the Kodi4Smartie DLL. Not really useful unless you are unsure which version of the DLL you are running.

Function 5: Displays custom information from kodi.
	usage: $dll(Kodi4smartie,5,method,item#sub-item)
	Example 1: 
		$dll(kodi4smartie,5,Player.GetPlayers,#type)

		In this example we are calling the Player.GetPlayers method. This method returns PlayerId and type. We want the value associated with type.
	Example 2:
		$dll(kodi4smartie,5,Player.GetProperties,totaltime#minutes)

		In this example we calling the Player.GetProperties method to get the totaltime item. The item returns hours,minutes,second and milisecond. We are looking for the the minutes.

Function 6: Display the current icon (from function 1). Can be useful for forming your own screens.
	usage : $dll(Kodi4smartie,6,,)
Function 7: Display Label - If kodi is not running then it will display the "knf_str" string.
	usage : $dll(Kodi4smartie,7,method,item)
	Example  1:
		$dll(kodi4smartie,7,XBMC.GetInfoLabels,System.CurrentWindow)
		
		This example will show the page or menu you are on (Home/Movies/Music/etc) 
	Example 2:
		$dll(kodi4smartie,7,XBMC.GetInfoLabels,System.CurrentControl)

		This example will show the current control/sub menu item.

Function 8: Duplicate of function 7 except it displays nothing instead of the "knf_str" string.

Function 9: Display kodi state
	Returns an integer of the current state: kodi_not_running(0),none(1), play(2), stop(3), pause(4), ff(5), rew(6), mute(7),idle(11 -- see idle_timer)

Function 10: Reset idle timer

Function 11: Get connected state 
	This function is better a detecting Kodi than function 3 since function 3 will return true before you can connect to Kodi.

Configuring LCD Smartie
-----------------------

In the lcd Smartie setup window for line 1 & 2 enter the following:

$dll(Kodi4smartie,1,,)
$dll(Kodi4smartie,2,,)

Configure the following for both lines:

Enable “Don’t scroll this line”
Disable “Continue on next line”
Disable “Center Text”

Advanced Setup
--------------
If you want to switch between screens you can use the following lcd smartie configurations to get you started:

Refresh interval 1000. screen 1-3:Enabled & Sticky

screen 1
line1: $dll(kodi4smartie,8,XBMC.GetInfoLabels,System.CurrentWindow)IDLE
line2: SCREEN

screen 2
line 1:$dll(kodi4smartie,7,XBMC.GetInfoLabels,System.CurrentWindow)
line 2:$dll(kodi4smartie,7,XBMC.GetInfoLabels,System.CurrentControl)

Screen 3
line 1:$dll(kodi4smartie,1,,)
line 2:$dll(kodi4smartie,2,,)$dll(kodi4smartie,10,,)

Action 1: $dll(kodi4smartie,9,,) = 1 gotoscreen(2)
Action 1: $dll(kodi4smartie,9,,) = 2 gotoscreen(3)
Action 1: $dll(kodi4smartie,9,,) = 11 gotoscreen(1)

Notifications
-------------
Kodi4Smartie listens for the following notifications from Kodi

"Player.OnPlay"
"Player.OnPause"
"Player.OnStop"
"Player.OnSpeedChanged"
"Application.OnVolumeChanged"

When the dll receives notifications it will display different information based on which notification is received and which player you are using (movie, song, picture, tv).


Configuration
-------------

While I have tried to make Kodi4Smartie somewhat configurable it is also based on what I wanted to see on each screen.

See the Kodi4Smartie.cfg file for information about configuring kodi4smartie.

. Fix a use_bars to allow the bars to be disabled. This was functionaly broke in 1.x
. Added functions 5-11
. Fix problem with looking for config in the wrong location
. Provide better error handling as well as fix a deadlock issue when kodi would exit mid request
. Remove Host from the configuration. Kodi4Smartie must be running on the same machine as Kodi.
